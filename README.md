Sweep
=====

A minesweeper clone.

This is a test project of mine to see if I can actually finish this.
The idea is to create a robust minesweeper API and then write a bunch of clients using different frameworks.

I haven't tried compiling it yet, so there is probably a bunch of errors.
Right now I'm just writing most, if not all, of the game logic and stuff.

License is GPLv3 just because.

Project components:
* libsweep [The actual library]

TODO:
* Add game code.
* Add demo recording and playback.
* Skin selection or something.
* Create a bunch of clients:
  * Standard I/O    {C}
  * ncurses         {C}
  * conio.h         {C}
  * QT4             {C++}
  * gtk3.0          {C}
  * wxWidgets       {C++}
  * WinAPI          {C}
  * .NET            {C++}
